%TODO: Mention gazebo and copelliasim problems

%TODO: Problems with motive
%      Data unreliability
%      having to make my own methods to clean data


%TODO: Tests not being too good, explain its due to dataset problems,
% Explain more time could have been used on methods fine tuning and experimentation, if there had been no problems with dataset creation.

%TODO: CNN network seems to approximate the median of all the ground truth regression angles.

% Results are liable to parameter tuning

% It would have been nice to test different types of feature extraction methods for classification.
