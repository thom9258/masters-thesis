\section{Conclusion}

This thesis is developed with the purose of researching \& designing a state-of-the-art sEMG-based HMI for a simulated prosthetic hand.
During the development of this thesis, a controllable prosthetic hand was developed in the simulation tool CoppeliaSim \cite{coppeliasim}, that is able to be controlled by the commonly used robotics communication software ROS2 \cite{ros2}.
The prosthetic hand is designed to have anatomically correct porpotions, with anatomically correct joints that allows the simulation to act and be controlled with similar movements as a real hand. 
The simulation is created with the purpose of providing an easy-to-use, freely available, advanced prosthetics simulation for others to use, modify and develop with. 
Another purpose of this thesis is to research and test state-of-the-art HMI techniques in the field of AI and ML, in order to compare and test different methods of converting sEMG based muscle activity into a useable controller scheme for a prosthetics device.
This thesis tests two different areas of HMI interfaces, ML based lower-arm intent classification and AI based finger movement regression.
Different models in each area are tested and compared, based on reccomendations of state-of-the-art
literature, in order to determine what models are ideal for the control of a prosthetic hand.
