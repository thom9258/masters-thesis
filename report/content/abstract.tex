\section*{Abstract}

% Introduction of problem
The human upper-limbs are some of the most important appendages of the human body.
The upper limbs of a human allows for interaction and manipulation of the environment, and acts as a crucial part of a functioning human body.
% Why we need to solve this problem
The loss of an upper limb, either congential or traumatic severely reduces a person's ability to interact with- and perform simple day-to-day tasks in the enviromnent required for basic human living.
% Introduction to existing solutions and their flaws
This is a major problem for the amputee, and can only be partially solved by rehabilitation using a crude prosthetic device, designed to provide a interface between a mechanical or robotic appendage, and the remaining appendage section of the amputee.
These prosthetics often only allow for a small degree of controllability through a limited interface at the attachment point of the prosthetic.
This often causes the amputee to neglect the rehabilitation and usage of the prosthetic, by choosing to reserve it for limited use, or reject it alltogetther.
Amputees not choosing to make use of a prosthetic device, often cause overuse of their remaining limbs.
% This thesis researches.... Intro to my work
This thesis aims to decrease the gap between existing prosthetic devices and their real-life counterpars, with the purpose of increasing controllability and interactability for the amputee, and by doing so, decreasing the amount of amputees choosing to reject their prosthetic device. 
This thesis researches different control methods of of a prosthetic device, with a focus on processing and interpreting sEMG data recorded from the upper appendage and the upper body.
Furthermore, this thesis prposes an anatomically correct simulated prosthetic hand, designed to visualize and test control methods of a prosthetic device.
Lastly, this thesis researches and compares different methods of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in order to convert sEMG data into a controllable output for a prosthetic device.
% This thesis proposes... outcome of my work
This thesis proposes the use of feature-based Linear Discriminant Analysis intent classification, and the usage of a 4-layer Recurrent Neural Network to predict the joint movements of the hand.
